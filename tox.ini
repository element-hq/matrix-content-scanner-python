# As of twisted 16.4, trial tries to import the tests as a package (previously
# it loaded the files explicitly), which means they need to be on the
# pythonpath. Our sdist doesn't include the 'tests' package, so normally it
# doesn't work within the tox virtualenv.
#
# As a workaround, we tell tox to do install with 'pip -e', which just
# creates a symlink to the project directory instead of unpacking the sdist.

# The current version of python-olm that's on PyPI does not include a types marker.
# Hopefully that's something we can fix at some point, but in the mean time let's not
# block things on this and instead use the wheels on gitlab.matrix.org's repository (which
# do have a type marker). We use --index-url (and not --extra-index-url) so that pip does
# not try to download the python-olm that's on pypi.org. This is fine because GitLab will
# redirect requests for packages it doesn't know about to pypi.org.
