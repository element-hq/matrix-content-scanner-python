# see https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes
# for error codes. The ones we ignore are:
#  W503: line break before binary operator
#  W504: line break after binary operator
#  E203: whitespace before ':' (which is contrary to pep8?)
#  E501: Line too long (black enforces this for us)
# (this is a subset of those ignored in Synapse)
ignore=W503,W504,E203,E501
